How to run.
This code is built in C++ using Visual Studio 2017. All the necessary libraries are included in "/Implementation". You simply have to run "GPU Based Particle System.sln". When you run it, you will see a texture-mapped particle system. I was not able to implement an UI for you to switch to an original implementation without the texture mapping unfortunately. However, you could simply go to "Particle System.cpp" and uncomment the parts that are commented out. You also need to go to "Renderer.cpp" to uncomment the parts to see the previous implementation and comment out the texture mapping part. I have also commented to let you know which part should be commented/uncommented for you to render different implementations. 

For your convenience, the ouputs are in "/output" directory as .JPG. 


Thanks for marking
